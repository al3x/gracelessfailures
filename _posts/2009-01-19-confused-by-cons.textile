While learning how to use lists:

{% highlight scala %}
val oneTwo = List(1, 2)
val threeFour = List(3, 4)
val oneTwoThreeFour = oneTwo :: threeFour //forgot one ":", I really meant to ":::" (concatenate)
val filteredList = oneTwoThreeFour.filter(n => n > 1)
{% endhighlight %}

scalac informed me:

<pre>
Error:Error:line (16)error: value > is not a member of scala.this.Any
val l2 = oneTwoThreeFour.filter(n => n > 1)
</pre>

Commenting out the offending line and replacing it with

{% highlight scala %}
println("oneTwoThreeFour " + oneTwoThreeFour)
{% endhighlight %}

yields

{% highlight scala %}
oneTwoThreeFour List(List(1, 2), 3, 4)
{% endhighlight %}

which clearly shows that the first element is not an Int.

However, the following line compiles:

{% highlight scala %}
val filteredList = oneTwoThreeFour.filter(n => n == 1)
{% endhighlight %}

probably because <tt>==</tt> is defined for scala.this.Any.
