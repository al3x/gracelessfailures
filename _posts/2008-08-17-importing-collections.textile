h1. {{ page.title }}

I'd like to propose the following convention when importing classes from Scala's collection library:

If you're using more than one class from the collections library, or might, import the packages themselves, like so:

{% highlight scala %}
import scala.collection.immutable
import scala.collection.mutable
{% endhighlight %}

They can then be unambiguously used throughout:

{% highlight scala %}
val cache = new mutable.HashMap[String, String]
{% endhighlight %}

What say ye?
