title: "Scala For Rubyists"

h1. {{ page.title }}

Over at "Coderspiel":http://technically.us/, n8han has implemented "_why's":http://whytheluckystiff.net/ semi-canoncial Ruby tutorial adventure game Dwemthy's Array "in Scala":http://technically.us/code/x/dwemthy_s-arrayhhhhhlist-in-scally.

I like this for two reasons:

# There aren't enough non-trivial side-by-side Ruby vs Scala examples for Rubyists like myself to learn from.
# The author has a number in his name, and that's how you know he's a righteous dude.

Also, for gems like this: "And finally, code is data or whatever."
