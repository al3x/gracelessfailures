h1. {{ page.title }}

It's been ages since any of the multiple contributors to this site posted anything. We're all busy folks, and some of us don't get to write Scala 100% of the time. Personally, my contributions to the site tapered off soon after I started working on "Programming Scala":http://programmingscala.com/ for O'Reilly. Once I wrapped up the book, my daily work was in Ruby for a while, which didn't leave me with much to post here.

I'm now back writing Scala day-to-day, and so I figured I would resurrect this blog as a place to share the things I'm learning.

I've imported all the previous content, although attribution to the various original authors and comments didn't make it over. You can still find the "full-fidelity archive":http://gracelessfailures.blogspot.com/ of the previous site.

Also, you can follow this blog on Twitter: "@gracelessblog":http://twitter.com/gracelessblog.

Welcome back!
